<h1> hi there</h1>
<h2> hi there</h2>
<body>hi there
</body>

**two asterisks make the text bold**
<br>

*one asterisk makes the text italicized*
<br>

***three asterisks make the text italicized and bold***

What does the text look like with absolutely no explicit formatting applied? And 
what happens if I just keep typing?
Will it do word wrap or just continue on the horizontal plane.  Ah, it will
word wrap in the rendered version, but the file will just run on **forever** in the 'text' file.  But as long
as I don't apply any explicit formatting
I can go to a new line in the editor and the rendered file will show the text as a single paragraph with line breaks
at the appropriate points.
