Add a class variable which is the same type as the service you are using
-- private ReportService reportService

Add the @Resource tag to the variable

//Example code
@Resource
private ReportService reportService;

//@Resource injects the class into another class -- using the class in another class

//@Service makes a spring/java class injectable -- registering the class
