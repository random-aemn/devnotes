Directives are instruction for DOM manipulation


* Structural directives can change elements within the DOM and are preceded by an asterisk *

Attribute directives only effect the element they sit on

NB: Cannot have two structural directives attached to the same element

They will create, update, or destroy an element in the DOM -> can be data, appearance, or behavior


Angular finds directives in the project through the @Directive decorator

There are built-in directives such as *ngIf and *ngFor

*ngif - structural directive for adding or deleting element(s) from the DOM.  They require the asterisk*

Attribute directives only impact the element they are placed on

ngStyle allows us to dynamically update styling

ngClass - allows us to dynamically add or change CSS classes
