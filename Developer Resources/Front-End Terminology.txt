Front End Terminology
------------------

"Generate a DTO"
	- go to the terminal and run the ng generate class command
	- DTO = Data Transfer Object
	- a DTO is an "envelope"/packaging - it holds things
	- We rarely (very rarely) put methods in it
	
			export class MyDTO{
				public description: 	string;
				public ic:				number;
				public myListOfStuff: 	MyStuff[]
			}
			

"Component" (Angular Component)
	- buliding block of a web page / lego piece
	- it is different from a service in that a component has HTML and CSS (Service does not)
	- it is different from a service in that a component has a route(Service does not)
	- it is different from a service in that a component has a SELECTOR
	- it is different from a service in that a component DIES when you leave the page 
	- it is different from a service in that a component is CREATED every time you enter a page
	

"Service" (Angular Service)
	- it's a class
	- it does not have HTML or CSS
	- Service sticks around 
	- It's how we reuse code in Angular Web Apps (that don't have look and feel)
	- Services are injected
	
	-Angular provides services that we can use -- the router, the formbuilder
	
		constructor(private myService: MyService,
					private router: Router,
					private formBuilder: FormBuilder ){
					
					}
	
	
	
"Class Variable"
	- It's not a local variable
	- it can be used by any method inside the class
	
		public/private/protected variableName: variableType
			public myForm: FormGroup;
			
"Local Variable"
	- we declare a local variable
		let myData: string = "hi mom";
		
"Passed-in Variable"
	- passed in argument to a method
	
		public getAllAlerts(aCaseId: number): AlertDTO[] {
			let myInfo: number =27;
		}
		
****PASSED-IN VARIABLES ARE PRECEDED BY "a"  //an Adam Resnick-ism -- lowercase a stands for "argument"
