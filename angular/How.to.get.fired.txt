How to get fired
-------------------
1 - Time card fraud
    Report what you did.  Not more and not less

2 - Lying
    don't lie on your timecard, don't misrepresent your ability or whether you can accomplish something
    If you say you can - do.  If you find out you can't do it, that's an honest mistake - own it and ask for help

3 - Don't do any work
